# Circular buffer

## Prerequisites

1. Complete this README.md by documenting how to build and run.
2. Use any build tool (e.g. make).
3. The code should compile cleanly, no errors/warnings.
4. Static memory only, no malloc()/new.

## Coding task

1. Write an circular buffer class with the following features:
    1. Compile time fixed size
    2. Static memory allocation only
    3. Typed
    4. Two put(data) overflow behaviors: overwrite and discard data.
2. Write tests showing your circular buffer in action.
